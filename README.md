# E-QUOTS
**A fully electronic, easier-to-use version of [QUOTS](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/)**.

## Background
Infection control is a serious concern for health care facilities. The best defense is diligence and knowledge. To that end, [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](http://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org) to augment best practices. The tools, known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools), are available as [PDFs on the APIC website](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation
The APIC QUOTS are intended to be quick and easy to use. They are provided as PDF documents which must be printed, completed by hand, and then (optionally) transcribed into a record keeping system. This project, E-QUOTS, aims to faciliate the process by being fully electronic, using only free and open web technologies without Adobe dependencies.

## Implementation
This re-implementation uses HTML to present the forms as a browser application. The forms are electronically fillable, exportable, and free of any dependencies other than a web browser. Once loaded, the forms may be saved and loaded from the file system, obviating the need for an internet connection. Completed forms tabulate automatically and are exportable as CSV for further analysis. They work on any device capable of running a web browser, including phones, tablets, or desktop machines. Completed forms are never communicated to any external parties.
