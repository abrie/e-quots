# E-QUOTS
**A fully electronic, easier-to-use version of [QUOTS](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/)**.

## Background
Infection control is of serious concern to health care facilities. The [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) to augment best practices. Known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools). The worksheets are available through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) or [APIC](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation
The worksheets are PDF documents. They must be printed, completed, and archived by hand. This project provides a paperless alternative.

## Implementation
E-QUOTS is a web app; an electronic version of QUOTS with automatic tabulation and export features. It requires no proprietary software or downloads. Here is a screen shot:

A completed form may be saved or emailed as CSV.

## The App

## Future
E-QUOTS was built with data export as a priority. The data is exported as CSV, which requires further processing to be useful. A future version could faciliate management of collected data; enabling search, statistics and charts.

## License
APIC and CDC created the original PDFs using funding from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Contract (#200-2016-89676).

This project is not affiliated with APIC or the CDC.
