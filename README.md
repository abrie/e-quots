# E-QUOTS
**A fully electronic, easier-to-use version of [QUOTS](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/)**.

## Background
Infection control is of serious concern to health care facilities. The [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) have developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](http://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org) to augment best practices. Known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools), the worksheets are available as PDF ion [APIC website](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation
The APIC QUOTS forms are provided as PDF documents. They must be printed, completed by hand, and then filed into a records system. Electronic forms would be better. This project is an electronic implementation of those steps. It reduces the effort required to assess best practice compliance.

## Implementation
E-QUOTS is a fillable form with an export feature. It requires only a web browser. Here is a screen shot:
