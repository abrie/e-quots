# E-QUOTS
**A fully electronic, easier-to-use version of [QUOTS](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/)**.

## Background
Infection control is of serious concern to health care facilities. The [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](http://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org) to augment best practices. Known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools). The worksheets are PDFs on [APIC website](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation
The APIC QUOTS forms are provided as PDF documents. They must be printed, completed, and filed by hand. Paperless would be better. This project is an electronic implementation of QUOTS. It aims to reduce the neccessary effort of infection control observation.

## Implementation
E-QUOTS is a fillable form with export feature. It requires no proprietary software or downloads. Here is a screen shot:

A completed form may be saved or emailed as CSV.
